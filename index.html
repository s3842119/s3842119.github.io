and I was born in Perth. I can only speak one language which is English however I can also understand Somali.
My recent educational achievement was completing VCE year 12. My hobbies include playing basketball or reading
manga mostly. An interesting fact about my self would be that as for a 190cm male I am afraid of cockroaches.

</div>

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">My interests in IT began when I was as little as 10 years old,
playing a Mario free-roam game. I was curious on how the world was built and the systems
Behind setting the characters to do certain things in the game, it further grew when I would
watch my cousin build a gaming PC. I think what sparked my interest in IT was when I took a IT course in 
Year 10 and 11. I would say my IT experience has not even begun, my experience starts now.
</div>

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">I mainly chose to come to RMIT because of the relevancy of
distance it is from my house and also because my sister went there and many of my friends
Are going there. I also heard that RMIT university is a great university for IT courses
because it gives experience in the field. Unlike other universities where it is more theoretical.

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">Hopefully throughout my course I would be able to learn
programming languages such as java, python etc.
I also hope to develop some ideas
That I can do on my own later to further help develop my IT skills.

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">My ideal job would be to become a software developer.

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">I would love to become a software developer because of the creativity behind it, as I was a kid i was really curious and creative about the world. I feel like a software developers position would aspire me to become a greater person and also make this world a greater place.
</div>
<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">Im going to be honest, I don't know much about software developers but just like any other person I think its about developing and creating softwares such as youtube etc. Most job applications that I search about software developers the skills that are required of them is to be able to code java, they also require other qualifications such as: 
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">
  <li>Css-Cascading Style Sheets is a template language utilized for portraying the introduction of a document written in a markup language like HTML.</li>
  <li>C#-C# is a broadly useful, multi-worldview programming language including solid composing, lexically perused, basic, decisive, useful, conventional, object-situated, and part arranged programming disciplines.</li>
  <li>Innovation-The ability to have a creative mind and think outside the box</li>
  <li>Problem-solving skills-Being able to challenge your self and get through difficult periods or tasks</li>
  <li>Time management skills-Having the skill to manage your self is very important as a software developer, organising your self will lead to an organised work life style.</li>
</ul>  

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">My current qualifications are not very ideal, I've only recently completed year 12 VCE and also have completed a 2 year IT course in year 10 and 11. Although my educational qualifications are low I do have some other qualifications in a real world working field, currently ive been working at Coles for about a year now, I've gained skills such as having good time management. I achieved this skill through being timed on the amount of pallets I have to complete during my shift, other skills I have achieved are helping customers and trying to understand their needs. Whether its customers who are frustrated over an item that isn't in stock to elderly foreign speaking customers, ive come across a lot and I am confident in my social skills.
</div>

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">My plan to achieve all my skills will not only be achieved through my degree, It will also continue to be achieved while I continue to work in the field.
Hopefully my first skills i have my eyes set on are to obtain a degree in this course, and through this course I also hope to get better at teamwork and communications. After my degree, while I'm
In the field I hope to find an idea in which I could do part time and spark it up along the years of working in IT.

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">The results of this first

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">The results of this test were as expected most of these attributes listed I know is me, so seeing these results have not affected me. However through seeing these results I may infect be an impact in my future career if I were to work in a group, because of me being an "introvert" I believe I wouldn't communicate as much 
To the group about ideas and problem solving tips. To counter this downside of me, before forming a group I should tell the other members of my limitations so that they can help me or cover up that weak spot.

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">The results of this second

You are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.

As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.

<div style="color: #E6E6FA; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 35px; margin: 0 0 58px;">My thoughts on the second test</div>
<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">My thoughts on the test results of this learning style test were not as I expected. First off I never knew I was a visual learning, I always read my way through things before tests and exams. However, this could greatly affect my teamwork's if I were to be placed in a group. As a visual learner we tend to learn by seeing the object or presenting it. If my team members were to just talk their way through project ideas and etc, I wouldn't be able to give my full potential. A way to counter it would be to inform team members that I am able to understand and learn through presentation. Hopefully they would understand and alter their way of presenting ideas.

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">The results of this third 
Test were:
You do sometimes like hanging out in a group of people but you really enjoy spending most of your time by yourself or with just one other friend. You feel pretty good just hanging around at home, whether itâ€™s to watch your favourite TV shows or to get stuck into a good book. Youâ€™re not a fan of big parties at all and too many people all in one place makes you feel a bit uncomfortable. You donâ€™t really say whatâ€™s on your mind that much, youâ€™d usually keep things to yourself and let others do the talking.

Youâ€™re a very open-minded person. You find new and different things really interesting and youâ€™re not afraid to be different. You love learning about new things even when youâ€™re not at school. You love it when you hear about a new idea and if itâ€™s a bit unconventional, all the better! Youâ€™re a creative person and love art, music, painting, drawing, or something else along these lines.

Youâ€™re a very organised person, both at home and at school. Your room is always tidy and youâ€™re usually on top of homework and assignments. You like to plan ahead for any upcoming events and people wouldnâ€™t call you the spontaneous type. Youâ€™re hard working and like to strive to do your best. You donâ€™t really like doing things spontaneously because youâ€™d much rather have a plan for most things. Youâ€™re always on top of all the things you need to do and you manage to remember them all without needing someone to.

Youâ€™re the definition of laid back. Taking it easy comes naturally to you. When things come up that are stressful and make other people worried (like an exam), you normally just breeze through it. Youâ€™re also someone that doesnâ€™t see to get angry very often and tend to stay chilled even when others would have blown their top. You can feel low sometimes, but it doesnâ€™t last for long.
Youâ€™re someone that enjoys helping people but you have a limit. You like to see the good in the world and realise that there are amazing people out there but youâ€™re also not going to pretend like there arenâ€™t bad people around as well. You like trusting people, but you realise that not everyone can always be trusted and sometimes people can turn their back on you, so youâ€™re a bit careful. You donâ€™t like getting into arguments but if you have to defend yourself then you will. Getting along with others is important to you but not to the point where you get taken advantage of.

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">All the things said in this test were somewhat true, I dont really get stressed under stressful situations etc. However reading the results of this test I can conclude that there are weaknesses in me that could affect my teamwork. Such as letting others do the talking rather than talking, this is a very negative attribute I have which could affect not only me but my other team members. If there were a problem to occur and I somewhat knew a way to fix it and decided that I were to wait and let someone else answer could just make the whole situation much worse. A simple was to tackle this problem would be to train my self now to start learning how to speak in groups and express my ideas.

<div style="color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; font-size: 54px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 58px; margin: 0 0 58px;">Project Ideas
</div>

<div style="color: #adb7bd; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0;">Since I was around the age of 9 I have been playing video games although I dont really play 
Them as much any more, I still love them. Theres a certain type of genre I love to play and its called MMO RPG. The past 2 years I have started to watch and read anime/manga, theres one particular show that I love that is called one piece. I have searched online if there are any MMO RPG one piece games but sadly there isn't. There also isn't really any good MMO RPG anime based game out there, hopefully I get the chance to create one not just for the money but for the creativity that is involved in it.
This project idea of mine will be useful because as the years increase more and more kids even adults watch anime, often gamers as well. The one piece anime franchise has sold more than 400 million copies of their manga, these high numbers clearly indicate the amount of people who would love to create their own character and set on their own journey in a universe they can only dream of. Both anime and games are a way of escape for many people these days, it can also help fight depression because it takes an individuals thoughts away by them focusing on the game play or scene.
The project would come with many features and usability within the world of the game, the game will be set in the one piece universe. The first feature like most MMO RPG would be a character creation system, users will be able to have a wide range of variety of character customisations such as nose width and eye colours etc. My main feature of the game that would make it stand out from other MMO RPG'S would be the engaging story. One piece is a show about pirates who explore many dangerous seas and islands, my main story line would be on setting on the journey. Since it is an online game, characters would be able to team up with others in search for treasures and fight together. The game is an open world free roam, with that in mind their would be enemies with difficulty levels ranging from weak to strong across different zones. Players would be able to join in groups, trade, hunt and travel together through their journey. The game will also have pvp features where players can challenge other players and get rewards, there would also be a quest line throughout the story. Quests will range from major down to minor quests. Since the game is a big open world that has many islands and seas, players would be able to ship from place to place and ride mounts such as horses. The game is a fantasy game so there would be skills such as fire breathing or ice attacks etc. There would be a weapon base system such as using a bow, sword, dual-wield, staff, and shield. There would be a loot feature in the game so players can acquire weapons and gear, players would also be able to customise their gear and sets, change their color, etc. The game will also have a market place feature where players can sell their items and other players can purchase it.
The softwares needed to run this project idea would be an RPG Maker VX Ace, IG maker, GG Maker, unreal engine 4, construct 2, Game Maker, Stencyl, and fixel which all run on windows 10. The hardwares that would be vital for my project would be desktops, a desktop with a ram of at least 16 GB, a very good Geforce graphics card, multiple monitors, and also a big hard drive system. Apart from that other tools such as a whiteboard for presenting ideas for my self, or a large a4 notepad for dotting down points to improve or change.
There would be 3 important softwares needed for writing this project idea. They include, Autodesk Maya, unreal engine 4, and visual studio. Visual studio is a software used for programming the code, Autodesk Maya is a 3D animated creator for creating characters etc. Lastly unreal engine 4 is what drives the game, it's a massive system comprised of tools and editors to allow you modify the game. To find many of these softwares and use it is not to hard, most of them charge a certain amount of fee to use for say 6months or 12 months. 
I believe that this project would have a great impact on the gaming industries and anime community, because it would be the first proper MMO RPG anime based game. If the project becomes successful I hope to host the game on many servers not just for example US, I want everyone across the world to be able to join together and play. The game would bring together both gamers and anime watchers into one community, most game admins out there don't listen to the people who play their game. So if there was a problem in the game or something that the players want to be changed I would listen, because we would be community.
